Course Requirements:

Written Assignments & Assessment Forms
Some units in this course require that you complete a Written Assignment. You are
required to submit your assignments by the indicated deadlines and, in addition, to peer
assess three (3) of your classmates’ assignments according to the instructions found in
the Assessment Form, which is provided to you during the following week. During this
peer assessment period, you are expected to provide details in the feedback section of
the Assessment Form, indicating why you awarded the grade that you did to your peer.
Failure to submit Written Assignments and/or Assessment Forms may result in failure of
the course.

</br>

<strong>Discussion Assignments & Response Posts/Ratings</strong><br>
Some units in this course require that you complete a Discussion Assignment. You are
required to develop and post a substantive response to the Discussion Assignment in
the Discussion Forum. A substantive response is one that fully answers the question that
has been posed by the instructor. In addition, you must extend the discussion by
responding to at least three (3) of your peers’ postings in the Discussion Forum and by
rating their posts. Instructions for proper posting and rating are provided inside the
Discussion Forum for each week. Discussion Forums are only active for each current and
relevant learning week, so it is not possible to contribute to the forum once the learning
week has come to an end. Failure to participate in the Discussion Assignment by posting
in the Discussion Forum and responding to peers as required may result in failure of the
course.

</br>

<strong>Learning Journal</strong><br>
Your instructor may choose to assign specific topics and/or relevant questions as a
weekly Learning Journal entry for you to complete, but you are still encouraged to also
use it to document your activities, record questions/problems you may have
encountered, reflect on the learning process, and draft answers for other course
assignments. The Learning Journal must be updated on a weekly basis because its
entries will be assessed by your instructor directly as a part of your final grade. The
Learning Journal will only be seen by your instructor.

</br>

<strong>Quizzes</strong><br>
This course will contain three types of quizzes – the Self-Quiz, the Graded Quiz, and the
Review Quiz. These quizzes may contain multiple choice, true/false, or short answer
questions. The results of the Self-Quiz will not count towards your final grade. However,
it is highly recommended that you complete the Self-Quiz to ensure that you have
adequately understood the course materials. Along with the Reading Assignments, the
results of the Self-Quiz should be used as part of an iterative learning process, to
thoroughly cover and test your understanding of course material. You should use the
results of your Self-Quiz as a guide to go back and review relevant sections of the
Reading Assignments. Likewise, the Review Quiz will not count towards your final grade,
but should also be used to assist you in a comprehensive review and full understanding
of all course material, in preparation for your Final Exam. Lastly, the results of the
Graded Quiz will count towards your final grade. Specific instructions on the format and
content of the Graded Quiz will be provided by your instructor.

</br>

<strong>Final Exam</strong><br>
The Final Exam will take place during the Thursday and Sunday of Week/Unit 9,
following the completion of eight units of work. The format of the Final Exam is similar
to that of the quizzes and may contain a combination of different question types. You
will have one attempt to take the exam, and it will be graded electronically. Specific
instructions on how to prepare for and take the Final Exam will be provided during
Week 8 (located inside the Unit 9 Learning Guide). Final Exams must be taken without
the use of course learning materials (both those inside and outside the course). If
particular materials are allowed for use during the exam, these will be noted in the
exam’s instructions.

</br>

<strong>Course Forum</strong><br>
The Course Forum is the place to raise issues and questions relating to the course. It is
regularly monitored by the instructors and is a good place to meet fellow students
taking the same course. While it is not required to participate in the Course Forum, it is
highly recommended.
